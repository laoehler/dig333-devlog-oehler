6. Create a groundbreaking musical instrument using Pearson's advice in the conclusion of the chapter to customize your circuit to play sound in a new way.


1\. 📚 Read Chapter 03 - The Hello World Oscillator (39-45) in [Electronic music from scratch](https://www.makershed.com/products/make-electronic-music-pdf) (Pearson). Write a comment on one of Pearson's phrases that speaks to you. (2-3 sentences) 

- Pearson's explanation of bread boards was very interesting to me, in particular how they got their name. I would be interested to see one of the original breadboards, and how they functioned. In my imagination they seem almost more useful than our bread boards because they would give easy access to the jumpers, so that the connections on the front, and those in the back could be easily modified. As a computer science major I also really liked his explanation of electronical and electronic devices, since people often overcomplicate/misunderstand the way that computers or other digital devices work when in reality they are just a complex intertwinement of simple discrete signals.


2\. Follow instructions in "My First Square Wave Oscillator" experiment (Pearson 59-71) to create a breadboard oscillator. Share a photo.

- This is a photo of my square wave oscillator after adding in an amplifier so that it is able to power an electric motor.


3\. Create at least one variation on your oscillator inspired by four variations on the circuit. Share a video of your your device.

- The video above shows the results of hooking up an LDR to the oscillator (I also have an amplifier attached).

- The second video shows the results of hooking up the same circuit to an amplifier minus the LED and LDR. I swapped out a pontentiometer for the LDR to control the oscillation better.

- The third video shows the same results I found in the first video but using a speaker as the output instead of an LED.


- Video shows my oscillator hooked up to an amplifier and an LDR with an LED as output to demonstrate how the LDR changes the oscillation created by the capacitor and IC.



4\. 📚 Read Chapter 4 - Amps, Reverbs, and Talkboxes (72-75) in [Electronic music from scratch](https://www.makershed.com/products/make-electronic-music-pdf) (Pearson). 






5\. Once you start listening you'll hear it everywhere. Share a link to a song that uses a synthesizer below.

- Your response



6\. Watch Synthesizer Basics: Amplitude, Oscillators, Timbre and describe

- Your response




7\. What is the difference between an analog and digital component?

- Analog components function using a range of volage to perform multiple functions whereas digital components use dicrete (binary) signals.



8\. [👉Activity: Analyze square waveforms with an oscilloscope](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G4jdcr8KzWpIiIduQyFiQJEG-PFJHpovJb9rWhxhNYw/edit?slide=id.g3b8d920f8b7_0_49#slide=id.g3b8d920f8b7_0_49). On the Snap-on Waveform demo board, which pot controls variable voltage (duty cycle) and which controls variable frequency (PWM slides)? What is a common use of each? 

- I messed around with the oscilliscope and snap on wave form demo board but could not generate the wave as demonstrated in the slide for some reason.
![IMG_1784](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/358edb3e-672e-4736-85ae-91afee378182)

- I got some success when attaching the oscilliscope to my oscillating circuit.

9\. Post a photo of your Snapon board testing.

- See response above.

10\. List one thing you learned in the [Learning Synth Playground](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/en/playground) by Ableton
