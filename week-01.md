1\. Follow the [class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G4jdcr8KzWpIiIduQyFiQJEG-PFJHpovJb9rWhxhNYw/edit?slide=id.g10e831bd841_0_47#slide=id.g10e831bd841_0_47) to create a functioning circuit on Tinkercad and link to it here.

- Link to my basic circuit: [https://tinkercad.com file](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/0to70Q1pBxm/editel?returnTo=%2Fdashboard)



2\. Share your maths using Ohm's law to find the resistor value for your Tinkercad circuit.

- Resistor value (Ω) = ( (Voltage supply - forward Voltage drop) / forward current) -> Ω = (9 - 2) / 0.2 -> Ω = 350



3\. 📚 Read Chapter 01 - A People's History of Electronic Music (2-14) and Chapter 02 - Musical Electricity for Electrophobes (15-up to 38) in [Electronic music from scratch](https://www.makershed.com/products/make-electronic-music-pdf) (Pearson). Write a comment on one of Pearson's phrases that speaks to you. (2-3 sentences) 

- Pearson's explanation of lightning was the most striking example discussed in these two chapters to me. This is because I have had the phenomenon explained to me many times, but the true nature of lightning and thunder has never really stuck with me. Due to the way he first thoroughly explains static electricity, along with our in class example on Wednesday, the idea of water molecules rubbing together creating static made a lot of sense. Additionally, the explanation of light and sound as a biproduct of the elictrical channel/current created between sky and ground made a lot of sense and de-mystified the phenomenon to me. So far I am really enjoying just reading this book to read it, not even purely as a learning tool.



4\. Explore Ishkur’s Guide to Electronic Music 2.0 https://music.ishkur.com/ referenced by Pearson. Describe the influence of one genre from this guide on your current musical listening habits. `(2-3 sentences)`

- I went down a rabbit hole of trying to consume as much information from this chart as I could. I do not know much about the majority of genres in the chart, but I spent a little time reading about each of them. I spent the bulk of my time tracing the hip hop timeline as that is the mnost mainstream genre included in the chart. It was really interesting to see where some of the artists I listen to fit in on the chart, and especially interesting to find new artists, or rediscover music I remember hearing in my childhood. I will definitely revisit this site going forward when I feel bored of my current songs, and have already sent the link to multiple friends.



5\. 🎬 Watch this introduction to [Synthesizing with Moog - Lesson 1: Listening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waN4owHeyaQ) (15:33). Describe one of Robert Moog's contributions to electronic music.

[![Synthesizing with Moog – Lesson 1: Listening](https://img.youtube.com/vi/waN4owHeyaQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waN4owHeyaQ)

- Moog invented the first commercially available synthesizer, with multiple modules packaged together. They came up with voltage control in order to change the different parameters of a synthesizer. 



6\. The Moog video references ideas also presented in Pearson's "Speaker as microphone" experiment (p.37) explain what a microphone, a speaker, and the human ear have in common? (2-3 sentences) 

- The human ear, a microphone, and a speaker all contain some type of drum or pressure sensing device which in the case of a microphone or human ear moves with pressure changes in the air and then the movement is interpreted into a frequency which represents sound. In the case of a speaker this drum is vibrated at a certain frequency controlled by the voltage running through the speaker and produces pressure changes in the air which causes sound.



7\. 🎬 Explore cinematic scores and other works created by [Wendy Carlos](https://www.google.com/search?q=wendy+carlos+filmography) using a Moog. Paste a link to an online example and describe what you like about the composition, performance, connection to themes in the film, etc. (2-3 sentences)
