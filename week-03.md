4. Follow the Piezomania (39) and Sound through your skull (42) experiments.

   

6. Create a groundbreaking musical instrument using Pearson's advice in the conclusion of the chapter to customize your circuit to play sound in a new way.


1\. 📚 Read Chapter 03 - The Hello World Oscillator (39-45) in [Electronic music from scratch](https://www.makershed.com/products/make-electronic-music-pdf) (Pearson). Write a comment on one of Pearson's phrases that speaks to you. (2-3 sentences) 

- Your response


2\. Follow instructions in "My First Square Wave Oscillator" experiment (Pearson 59-71) to create a breadboard oscillator. Share a photo.

- This is a photo of my square wave oscillator after adding in an amplifier so that it is able to power an electric motor.



3\. Create at least one variation on your oscillator inspired by four variations on the circuit. Share a video of your your device.

- Video shows my oscillator hooked up to an amplifier and an LDR with an LED as output to demonstrate how the LDR changes the oscillation created by the capacitor and IC.



4\. 📚 Read Chapter 4 - Amps, Reverbs, and Talkboxes (72-75) in [Electronic music from scratch](https://www.makershed.com/products/make-electronic-music-pdf) (Pearson). 






5\. Once you start listening you'll hear it everywhere. Share a link to a song that uses a synthesizer below.

- Your response



6\. Watch Synthesizer Basics: Amplitude, Oscillators, Timbre and describe

- Your response




7\. What is the difference between an analog and digital component?

- Analog components function using a range of volage to perform multiple functions whereas digital components use dicrete (binary) signals.



8\. [👉Activity: Analyze square waveforms with an oscilloscope](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G4jdcr8KzWpIiIduQyFiQJEG-PFJHpovJb9rWhxhNYw/edit?slide=id.g3b8d920f8b7_0_49#slide=id.g3b8d920f8b7_0_49). On the Snap-on Waveform demo board, which pot controls variable voltage (duty cycle) and which controls variable frequency (PWM slides)? What is a common use of each? 

- Your response





9\. Post a photo of your Snapon board testing.

- Your response



10\. List one thing you learned in the [Learning Synth Playground](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/en/playground) by Ableton 

- Your response
